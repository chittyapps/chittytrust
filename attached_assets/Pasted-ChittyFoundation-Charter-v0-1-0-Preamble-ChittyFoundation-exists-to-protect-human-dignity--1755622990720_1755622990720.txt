ChittyFoundation — Charter (v0.1)
0) Preamble
￼
￼
ChittyFoundation exists to protect human dignity, ownership, and fairness in People × AI systems. It stewards the rules that make Chitty‑ecosystem products safe, portable, equitable, and auditable.
1) Purpose & Mandate
* Steward the standards for data/DNA ownership, attribution, compensation, safety, and transparency across the ecosystem.
* Certify products and organizations that comply (“ChittyCertified”).
* Enforce rights (e.g., anti‑piracy of AI DNA, ethical exit, portability).
* Govern upgrades to shared protocols (identity, attribution, audit) and resolve disputes.
2) Scope
* Applies to: ChittyTrust, ChittyVerify, ChittyChain, ChittyDNA, ChittyScore, ChittyPay, and any Chitty‑Certified tool or partner.
* Covers humans and AI agents that operate within these systems.
* Respects applicable law across jurisdictions; when in conflict, Foundation seeks the most protective position for contributors.
3) Core Principles (Non‑negotiables)
1. You Own Your Data & DNA – Individuals own their decision patterns and contributions; orgs obtain licenses, not ownership.
2. Portability by Default – Export, revoke, and migrate are baseline rights (with reasonable, transparent rate‑limits to prevent abuse).
3. Attribution → Compensation – Traceable contributions must map to value; value must map to loyalty‑based compensation.
4. Privacy with Proof – Content can remain private while proofs and audit trails remain verifiable.
5. Human Safety & Dignity – No systems for coercion, surveillance abuse, or harm; prioritize well‑being and informed consent.
6. Transparency over Theater – Decisions, metrics, and economic flows are explainable and auditable.
7. Diversity as Resilience – Avoid monocultures; promote varied human and model “DNA” to reduce brittleness and extraction.
4) Governance Model
4.1 Bodies
* Board of Stewards (BoS) – 7–11 members, mixed seats for: Contributors (3–5), Partners/Orgs (2–3), Independent/Public Interest (2–3).
* Councils (standing):
    * Ethics & Safety
    * Data Ownership & Portability (PDX Spec)
    * Attribution & Compensation (A/C)
    * Compliance, Audit & Risk
    * Security & IP (Piracy Protection Unit)
    * Dispute Resolution/Ombuds
* Advisory Forums: open assemblies for shareowners and users; non‑binding but published minutes.
4.2 Proposals & Voting
* Categories: Standard (protocol clarifications), Material (policy or economics), Constitutional (core principles).
* Thresholds (dual‑majority):
    * Standard: simple majority of BoS.
    * Material: majority of BoS and majority of Contributor reps.
    * Constitutional: ⅔ of BoS and ⅔ of Contributor reps; 30‑day public comment.
* Emergency procedure: Ethics & Safety + Audit may impose 30‑day safeguards; BoS review within 7 days.
4.3 Conflicts & Transparency
* Mandatory conflict disclosures; recusals recorded.
* Public transparency reports on changes, incidents, certifications, and enforcement actions.
5) Policies & Standards
5.1 Data Ownership & Licensing
* ChittyDNA Contributor License (CDCL): perpetual ownership by contributor; org receives scoped, revocable license.
* Revocation/Exit: notice windows + rate‑limited migration to protect platform stability; all terms published per integration.
* Personal AI DNA Vaults: encrypted, portable, contributor‑controlled.
5.2 Attribution & Compensation
* Trace Chain: Contribution → Deployment → Usage → Impact → Payment (recorded on ChittyChain).
* Attribution Models: Impact‑weighted, time‑weighted, role‑tiered, or hybrid—selected at project start from Foundation‑approved templates.
* Decay & Evolution: legacy DNA receives declining share as new work dominates; floor and buyout options when components become infrastructure/commons.
* Human Factors: peer‑recognized enablement (mentorship, retention, conflict resolution) earns calibrated multipliers.
5.3 Safety, Privacy, & Audit
* Privacy with Proof: content‑minimal audit (hashes, ZK proofs when applicable).
* Right‑Sized Retention: ephemeral messaging with durable proofs.
* Independent audits for certified participants; incident response timelines and disclosure rules.
5.4 Anti‑Piracy & Clean IP
* PirateProtect: continuous similarity detection; notice‑and‑verify; enforce or remediate.
* Clean‑Room Certification for partners (no cross‑contamination of proprietary DNA).
5.5 Ethical Exit & Values Trigger
* Values Charter includes: fair compensation, human dignity, environmental responsibility, anti‑exploitation (e.g., no weaponization/surveillance abuses).
* If violated, Exit Rights activate: staged migration (e.g., 30/60/90‑day gates), with forensics snapshots for all parties; supermajority can mandate spin‑off.
5.6 Succession & Caretakers
* DNA and loyalty flows are estate assets.
* Optional AI Caretaker Program: vetted maintainers keep avatars current post‑retirement/death with predefined shares.
5.7 Liability & Redress
* Traceable decision chains assign responsibility; insurance and caps per certified tier.
* Ombuds + binding arbitration options; public post‑mortems (sensitive content redacted) for systemic learning.
6) Certification (ChittyCertified)
* Tiers (Bronze/Silver/Gold) based on compliance depth (PDX portability, audit quality, clean IP, attribution solidity, fair‑pay metrics).
* Public registry of certifications and any suspensions.
7) Reporting & Metrics
* Annual Fairness Report: pay ratios, loyalty distributions, portability stats, piracy incidents, exit requests/outcomes.
* North‑Stars: Portability success rate, % of transactions with complete attribution, time‑to‑attribution, contributor satisfaction, safety incidents (zero target).
8) Amendments
* Constitutional amendments require supermajorities and public comment; emergency changes sunset unless ratified.
9) Definitions (extract)
* DNA: durable representation of a person’s decision patterns, contributions, and model deltas.
* Loyalty: ongoing compensation tied to active use/impact of licensed DNA.
* PDX: Portable DNA eXchange specification for export/import and proofs.
