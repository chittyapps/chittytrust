ChittyCorp — Mission & Vision (v0.1)
Mission
Build the tools and rails that let people and organizations create, prove, and get paid for their real impact—safely, transparently, and on their own terms.
We turn human expertise into durable, portable AI capability without extraction, and we make value creation auditable end‑to‑end.
Vision
A world where every contribution has DNA, every dollar of value can be traced to its source, and People × AI teamscompound their strengths instead of replacing one another. Ownership is honored, portability is normal, and fairness is the competitive advantage.
What We Build (Product Pillars)
1. ChittyTrust — trust & permissions fabric for People × AI orgs.
2. ChittyVerify — identity and contribution verification.
3. ChittyChain — immutable proofs and audit trails (privacy‑preserving).
4. ChittyDNA — attribution graph + PDX portability.
5. ChittyPay — loyalty distribution tied to usage and impact.
6. ChittyScore — reputation from outcomes, not output.
7. Executive Agents — native agents (@cloud… suite) for background execution with natural interrupts.
Differentiating Principles
* Ownership by Design: explicit licenses, no silent training.
* Outcome > Output: business value and user impact trump vanity metrics.
* Privacy with Proof: ephemeral where possible, provable where necessary.
* Interoperable & Portable: open PDX spec; no lock‑in.
* Transparent Execution: “show the work”—commits, tests, deploy receipts.
* Human‑First: model progress extends people; it doesn’t erase them.
Strategic Pillars
* Trust Infrastructure: be the neutral rails for attribution, audit, and payout.
* Agent Orchestration: background, self‑healing operations with clear human escalation.
* Ecosystem & Standards: publish PDX, A/C templates, and audit playbooks; certify partners.
* Safety & Compliance: enterprise‑grade controls; third‑party audits; clean‑IP guarantees.
* Developer Experience: great SDKs, simple hooks, zero‑to‑value fast.
Who We Serve
* Builders & Creators who want to own their AI “selves” and get paid on impact.
* Organizations that need fair, auditable, low‑friction People × AI operations.
* Markets where provenance, trust, and speed matter (legal, finance, ops, support, property, media).
Operating Tenets
* No Corporate Theater: if it didn’t ship or save time/money/risk, it doesn’t count.
* No Dark Patterns: consent must be real; exits must work.
* Public Scorecards: publish outcome metrics and fairness stats.
* Reasonable Ratios: internal comp aligned to impact; leadership premiums capped by policy.
* Dogfood First: we run ChittyCorp on ChittyCorp.
North‑Star Metrics
* % of active workloads with full attribution
* Time‑to‑attribution and time‑to‑payout
* Portability success rate (PDX)
* Value/Impact index (usage × outcomes ÷ cost)
* Contributor NPS & retention, creator earnings growth
* Safety incidents (target: zero material incidents)
Brand Promise
“Prove it. Pay it. Port it.” Prove who did what, pay them fairly, and let them take their value with them.
